## Background

Developmental AI is a new branch of AI that aims to program a minimal initial system able to develop its intelligence by itself. If implemented in a robot, it will initially behave like a newborn baby, then it will become increasingly intelligent as it interacts with the world.


## Audience and prerequisite
The GoIDEAL  welcomes all audience without prerequisite. It might particularly interest three categories of participants:

- **Curious persons** who wish to discover the current state of the art of Developmental AI and understand its underlying concepts.

- **Developers** and roboticists who wish to program their own developmental robot or virtual agent.
 
- **Scientists** in **computer science** and **cognitive science** who wish to contribute to the Developmental AI research.

This repo is designed to satisfy these three types of participants.
